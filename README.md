# Card Rougelite
This is a personal project made in Angular.  
Singleplayer only for now, but 2-4 player co-op is the dream!  
### My plans for the game:  
+ Visual theme is 'celestial'
+ Metaprogression
+ Bunch of cards to collect
+ Procedurely generated routes, combined with handcrafted map design
+ Elements: 
  + Solar
  + Lunar
  + Stardust
  + Void
+ Elemental reactions (Solar + Lunar = Eclipse)

## Run in development mode:
1. `npm i`
2. `npx json-server cards.json`
3. `npx ng serve --open`
